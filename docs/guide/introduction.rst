Introduction
============

The first thing you need to understand before you use |bonobo|, or not, is what it is and what it is not, so you
can understand if it could be a good fit for your use cases.

How it works?
:::::::::::::

**Bonobo** is an **Extract Transform Load** framework aimed at coders, hackers, or any other people who are at ease with
terminals and source code files.

It is a **data streaming** solution, that treats datasets as ordered collections of independent rows, allowing to process
them "first in, first out" using a set of transformations organized together in a directed graph.

Let's take a few examples.

Simplest linear graph
---------------------

.. graphviz::

    digraph {
        rankdir = LR;
        stylesheet = "../_static/graphs.css";

        BEGIN [shape="point"];
        END [shape="none" label="..."];
        BEGIN -> "A" -> "B" -> "C" -> "END";
    }

One of the simplest, by the book, cases, is an extractor sending to a transformation, itself sending to a loader (hence
the "Extract Transform Load" name).

.. note::

    Of course, |bonobo| is aiming at real-world data transformations and can help you build all kinds of data-flows.

Bonobo will send an "impulsion" to all transformations linked to the `BEGIN` node (shown as a little black dot on the left).

On our example, the only node having its input linked to `BEGIN` is `A`.

`A`'s main topic will be to extract data from somewhere (a file, an endpoint, a database...) and generate some output.
As soon as the first row of `A`'s output is available, |bonobo| will start asking `B` to process it. As soon as the first
row of `B`'s output is available, |bonobo| will start asking `C` to process it.

While `B` and `C` are processing, `A` continues to generate data.

This approach can be efficient, depending on your requirements, because you may rely on a lot of services that may be
long to answer or unreliable, and you don't have to handle optimizations, parallelism or retry logic by yourself.

.. note::

    The default execution strategy uses threads, and makes it efficient to work on I/O bound tasks. It's in the plans
    to have other execution strategies, based on subprocesses (for CPU-bound tasks) or `dask.distributed` (for big
    data tasks that requires a cluster of computers to process in reasonable time).

Graphs with divergence points (or forks)
----------------------------------------

.. graphviz::

    digraph {
        rankdir = LR;
        stylesheet = "../_static/graphs.css";

        BEGIN [shape="point"];
        END [shape="none" label="..."];
        END2 [shape="none" label="..."];
        BEGIN -> "A" -> "B" -> "END";
        "A" -> "C" -> "END2";
    }

In this case, any output row of `A`, will be **sent to both** `B` and `C` simultaneously. Again, `A` will continue its
processing while `B` and `C` are working.


Graph with convergence points (or merges)
-----------------------------------------

.. graphviz::

    digraph {
        rankdir = LR;
        stylesheet = "../_static/graphs.css";

        BEGIN [shape="point"];
        BEGIN2 [shape="point"];
        END [shape="none" label="..."];
        BEGIN -> "A" -> "C" -> "END";
        BEGIN2 -> "B" -> "C";
    }

Now, we feed `C` with both `A` and `B` output. It is not a "join", or "cartesian product". It is just two different
pipes plugged to `C` input, and whichever yields data will see this data feeded to `C`, one row at a time.


What is it not?
:::::::::::::::

|bonobo| is not:

* A data science, or statistical analysis tool, which need to treat the dataset as a whole and not as a collection of
  independent rows. If this is your need, you probably want to look at `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_.

* A workflow or scheduling solution for independent data-engineering tasks. If you're looking to manage your sets of
  data processing tasks as a whole, you probably want to look at `Airflow <https://airflow.incubator.apache.org/>`_.
  Although there is no |bonobo| extension yet that handles that, it does make sense to integrate |bonobo| jobs in an
  airflow (or other similar tool) workflow.

* A big data solution, `as defined by Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data>`_. We're aiming at "small
  scale" data processing, which can be still quite huge for humans, but not for computers. If you don't know whether or
  not this is sufficient for your needs, it probably means you're not in "big data" land.
